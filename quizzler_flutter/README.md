A simple quiz app with the goal of learning the basics of Object Oriented Programming

## Object Oriented Programing

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Abstraction
Break something complex into smaller pieces

The idea is break full tasks into simpler and single task functions.

(Instead of a single person doing everything in a restaurant, divide the task with multiple people that will only do that specific task. Eg: cleaner, waiter, chef, host and etc.)

### Encapsulation
Prevent one object from interfering with another's task by making its properties private within a class and providing access to its values via functions that only return its value.

(Instead of allowing the waiters into the kitchen and interfering on how the chef prepares the meals, separate them in different areas and make them comunicate with each other via restricted ways.)

### Inherirance
Gives a class the hability to inherit properties and methods from a parent class using the keyword ***'extends'*** when declaring a class.

(A Chef must know how to cook, so a Chef class should 'extend' a Cook class)

### Polymorphism
Gives a class the hability to not only inherit but also modify the inherited properties and methods from its parent class.

The keyword ***@override*** allows the child class to rewrite a property or method from its parent class.

The keyword ***super.*** allows the child class to reuse its parent property or method even after *overriding* it.
