A simple quiz app with the goal of learning the basics of Object Oriented Programming

## Object Oriented Programing

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Abstraction
Break something complex into smaller pieces

The idea is break full tasks into simpler and single task functions. (Instead of a single person doing everything in a restaurant, divide the task with multiple people that will only do that specific task. Eg: cleaner, waiter, chef, host and etc.)

### Encapsulation
Prevent one object from interfering with another's task.
